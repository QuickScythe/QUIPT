# Teleportation Requests
This is a Server Owner feature that allows players to send teleport requests to other players. The receiving player can then accept (`/tpaccept`) or deny (`/tpdeny`) the request. Requests can be sent by typing `/tpr <player>`, and have 30 seconds to be accepted or denied before they expire.
